在规定时间上床睡觉 确保黑暗 安静

在快起床的时候 渐进的提高光照 提高声音音量 辅助起床

属于智能家居的范畴 智能家居代码

By simply working in bed, lying down or not, using pillow or not, sore ass or not, I somehow lose sleep in bed.
Don't know how to explain, but this is simply true. I admit many people have lost their sleep in bed too, but never comfortable to do so. I am somehow better than them.
