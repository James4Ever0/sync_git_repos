# the still image to singing face bot, lip-sync video generation

wombo.ai, likely to be talking head or yanderifier

all in one colab text to talking face generation, also consider paddlespeech example:
https://github.com/ChintanTrivedi/ask-fake-ai-karen

avaliable from paddlegan as an example used in paddlespeech, the artificial host.

lip-sync accurate wav2lip:

lipgan generate realistic lip-sync talking head animation(fully_pythonic branch or google colab notebook):

google's lipsync implementation, using tensorflow facemesh:

matamata using vosk models, recommend to use gentle lip-sync method:
