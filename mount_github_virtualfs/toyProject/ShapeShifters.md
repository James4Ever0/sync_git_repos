simply do not take offer with some serious math. if really want to challenge yourself, go ahead and try, but do not even make a move to place the bid. you know you are sick of deadlines.

this shit is over but we still have the code and the pdf. still recoverable. it is about mmp/pbrt_v3 and the displacement map on a damn sphere. calculate occulusion and more according to input.
