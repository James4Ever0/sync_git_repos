# Cats video with lyrics (Netdisk VIP)

First source the cats video. We are downloading it on baidu ai from baidu netdisk.
Can you parse the download link directly?

found script from greasyfork.

why the download speed is low? why there is only one connection? shall i use thunder?

the thunder can be invoked, may you test it here.

so i agree all i need is some sort of communication, across these devices.

unsure if it is encrypted. why i always found these little sites with massive resources?

the tool itself says it is avaliable for use vip cookies to download files from commandline. let's try this.

the speed unfortunately remains the same. how about download some big files?

core-dumped. let's try curl.

looks good. so we can either search and download a bunch of files with commandline, or download big files with android client.

i quit the payment after all. the price is too high and i do not want to step into this shit. it seems that i can initialize the download anyway, not funny after all.

so how do you make a point? how to source the cats video?

sourcing the video is the fundamental step in video production, whether it is shotting by yourself or grabbing from the web, you must do this, with as little help as possible.
